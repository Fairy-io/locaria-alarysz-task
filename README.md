# Customer Data Aggregation API

A REST API wrapper that aggregates customer data from FINANCERO (financial billing system) and ODERINO (order processing system) platforms, providing a unified interface for accessing customer information.

## üåê Live Demo

You can explore the working API at [locaria-alarysz-task-dev.magicfe.net/docs](https://locaria-alarysz-task-dev.magicfe.net/docs). This is a fully functional deployment of the application, where you can:

-   See the actual response formats
-   Experiment with different customer IDs

## üöÄ Features

-   Single endpoint for accessing aggregated customer data
-   Robust error handling with partial failure support
-   In-memory caching for frequently requested data
-   Modular architecture for easy extension
-   Automated deployment pipeline
-   Comprehensive test coverage

## üìù API Documentation

### Endpoint: GET /api/customers/{customer_id}/summary

Retrieves aggregated customer data from both FINANCERO and ODERINO systems.

#### Parameters

#### Response

```json
{
    "customer_id": "string",
    "company_name": "string",
    "address": {
        "street": "string",
        "city": "string",
        "state": "string",
        "zip": "string",
        "country": "string"
    },
    "billing_info": {
        "payment_terms": "string",
        "credit_limit": 1,
        "currency": "string"
    },
    "invoices": [
        {
            "invoice_id": "string",
            "amount": 1,
            "currency": "string",
            "status": "string",
            "due_date": "string"
        }
    ],
    "orders": [
        {
            "order_id": "string",
            "status": "string",
            "order_date": "string",
            "total_value": 1,
            "currency": "string",
            "vendor": "string",
            "jobs": [
                {
                    "job_id": "string",
                    "status": "string",
                    "completion_date": "string"
                }
            ],
            "delivery": {
                "delivery_status": "string",
                "delivery_date": "string",
                "tracking_number": "string",
                "carrier": "string"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Partial Failure Handling

The API implements graceful degradation when some data sources are unavailable. In such cases, the response will include error information for the failed components while still returning available data. For example:

```json
{
    "customer_id": "12345",
    "company_name": "ABC Corp",
    "address": {
        "street": "123 Main St",
        "city": "New York",
        "state": "NY",
        "zip": "10001",
        "country": "USA"
    },
    "billing_info": {
        "error": true,
        "code": "NOT_FOUND",
        "details": {
            "id": "12345",
            "type": "billing"
        }
    },
    "invoices": {
        "error": true,
        "code": "NOT_FOUND",
        "details": {
            "id": "12345",
            "type": "invoices"
        }
    },
    "orders": [
        {
            "order_id": "ORD-001",
            "status": "Delivered",
            "order_date": "2024-11-01",
            "total_value": 2000,
            "currency": "USD",
            "vendor": "Vendor A",
            "jobs": [
                {
                    "job_id": "JOB-001",
                    "status": "Completed",
                    "completion_date": "2024-11-05"
                }
            ],
            "delivery": {
                "delivery_status": "Delivered",
                "delivery_date": "2024-11-10",
                "tracking_number": "TRK123456789",
                "carrier": "DHL"
            }
        },
        {
            "order_id": "ORD-002",
            "status": "In Progress",
            "order_date": "2024-11-05",
            "total_value": 5000,
            "currency": "USD",
            "vendor": "Vendor B",
            "jobs": {
                "error": true,
                "code": "NOT_FOUND",
                "details": {
                    "id": "ORD-002",
                    "type": "jobs"
                }
            },
            "delivery": {
                "error": true,
                "code": "NOT_FOUND",
                "details": {
                    "id": "ORD-002",
                    "type": "delivery"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Caching

The API implements a simple in-memory caching mechanism for customer summaries. The current implementation:

-   Caches customer summaries in memory
-   Uses customer_id as the cache key
-   Has no expiration or invalidation mechanism
-   Persists for the lifetime of the application instance

Note: This is a basic implementation that will be improved in future versions. See the Future Improvements section for planned caching enhancements.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

-   **Language**: TypeScript
-   **Runtime**: Bun
-   **Containerization**: Docker
-   **Deployment**: Google Cloud Run
-   **CI/CD**: Google Cloud Build
-   **Infrastructure**: Terraform (via separate infrastructure repository)
-   **Testing**: Bun test runner

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The solution is built with modularity and scalability in mind:

1. **Core Components**:

    - REST API wrapper
    - Data aggregation service
    - Caching layer
    - Error handling system

2. **Deployment Architecture**:
    - Containerized application
    - Serverless deployment on Google Cloud Run
    - Automated CI/CD pipeline
    - Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

## üéØ Technical Decisions

### Framework Choice

I chose [Elysia](https://elysiajs.com/) as the HTTP framework because it provides excellent TypeScript support and is powered by [Bun](https://bun.sh/), one of the fastest JavaScript runtimes available. This combination ensures both type safety and high performance.

### Deployment Infrastructure

To accelerate development and maintain consistency, I leveraged my existing infrastructure:

1. **GitHub Template Repository**

    - Used my [bun-elysia-template](https://github.com/Fairy-io/bun-elysia-template) as a foundation
    - This template provides a standardized project structure and common utilities
    - Significantly reduced setup time while maintaining best practices

2. **Deployment Infrastructure**

    - Utilized my private infrastructure repository for deployment
    - Currently focused on Google Cloud Run for simplicity and cost-effectiveness
    - The deployment process is documented in the [bun-elysia-template](https://github.com/Fairy-io/bun-elysia-template?tab=readme-ov-file#deploying-application)
    - Areas for improvement:
        - Enhanced secret management
        - More sophisticated infrastructure patterns
        - Additional cloud services integration
        - Potentially use of Kubernetes

3. **Custom SDK**
    - Incorporated parts of my private SDK for testing and implementation
    - The goal of this SDK was to simplify testing process and speed up setting up external services connectors
    - While this accelerated development, I acknowledge its current limitations:
        - Some over-engineering in certain areas
        - Room for better modularization

These technical decisions were made to balance development speed with maintainability, while keeping the door open for future improvements and scaling.
