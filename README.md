## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Bun runtime
-   Docker
-   Google Cloud SDK (for deployment)

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

3. Run tests:

```bash
bun tests
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

### Deployment

The application is automatically deployed to Google Cloud Run through the CI/CD pipeline. The deployment process includes:

1. Building the Docker image
2. Running tests
3. Pushing to Google Artifact Registry
4. Deploying to Cloud Run

## üîÆ Future Improvements

Given more time and resources, here are the planned improvements:

1. **Error Handling Enhancement**

    - Implement status code-based error detection
    - Standardize error responses across all services
    - Add more descriptive error payloads

2. **SDK Optimization**

    - Refactor connection utility
    - Improve type safety
    - Add better documentation

3. **Observability**

    - Implement structured logging
    - Add distributed tracing
    - Set up monitoring and alerting

4. **Caching Strategy**

    - Migrate from in-memory to Redis
    - Implement cache invalidation

5. **Security Enhancements**

    - Implement Google Secret Manager integration
    - Add service-to-service authentication
    - Implement rate limiting

6. **Additional Features**

    - Add more endpoints for specific data queries
    - Implement real-time updates
    - Implement API versioning

7. **Type System Improvements**
    - Replace string-based status fields with proper enums
    - Implement proper date handling with ISO 8601 format
    - Create shared type definitions between services

## üåê Live Demo

You can explore the working API at [locaria-alarysz-task-dev.magicfe.net/docs](https://locaria-alarysz-task-dev.magicfe.net/docs). This is a fully functional deployment of the application, where you can:

-   Test the API endpoints
-   View the API documentation
-   See the actual response formats
-   Experiment with different customer IDs

## üéØ Technical Decisions

### Framework Choice

I chose [Elysia](https://elysiajs.com/) as the HTTP framework because it provides excellent TypeScript support and is powered by [Bun](https://bun.sh/), one of the fastest JavaScript runtimes available. This combination ensures both type safety and high performance.

### Development Infrastructure

To accelerate development and maintain consistency, I leveraged my existing infrastructure:

1. **GitHub Template Repository**

    - Used my [bun-elysia-template](https://github.com/Fairy-io/bun-elysia-template) as a foundation
    - This template provides a standardized project structure and common utilities
    - Significantly reduced setup time while maintaining best practices

2. **Deployment Infrastructure**

    - Utilized my private infrastructure repository for deployment
    - Currently focused on Google Cloud Run for simplicity and cost-effectiveness
    - The deployment process is documented in the [bun-elysia-template](https://github.com/Fairy-io/bun-elysia-template?tab=readme-ov-file#deploying-application)
    - Areas for improvement:
        - Enhanced secret management
        - More sophisticated infrastructure patterns
        - Additional cloud services integration
        - Potentially use of Kubernetes

3. **Custom SDK**
    - Incorporated parts of my private SDK for testing and implementation
    - The goal of this SDK was to simplify testing process and speed up setting up external services connectors
    - While this accelerated development, I acknowledge its current limitations:
        - Some over-engineering in certain areas
        - Room for better modularization

These technical decisions were made to balance development speed with maintainability, while keeping the door open for future improvements and scaling.
